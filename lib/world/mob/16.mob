lady young sacrafice princess~
the Lady Rowenmantle~
Before you, bound and gagged is an attractive young woman.
~
Given other circumstances, you would imagine the Lady to be a stunning 
beauty. Right now, however, she is a mess of tears and blood. Bound at the
hands and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She is the last living heir of Chelnar's
to the throne.

You see a @Mstrangly tenticled@[3] beast flying around here.

A pinkish thing about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast
pairs of dorsal fins or membranous wings and several sets of articulate 
limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of
very short antenna, where a head would ordinarily be...Sometimes walked on
all their legs and sometimes on the hindmost pair only.

flying demon strange nightgaunt~
the @bNightgaunt@n~
A strange looking @Rdemon@[3] is flying around here on leathery wings.
~
Shocking and uncooth black things with smooth, oily, whalelike surfaces,
unpleasant horns that curve inward toward each other, bat wings whose 
beating made no sound, ugly prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lash
needlessly and disquietingly. And worst of all, they never smiled because
they had no faces at all to smile with, but only a suggestive blankness 
where a face ought to be. All they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle;
that was the way of nightgaunts.
